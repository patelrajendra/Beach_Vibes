 Best match making of beaches for you
 
 # Inspiration
People are fed up of this Covid-19 pandemic and wish to go out to have some fun. Also, after all this negative environment of the pandemic, no one wants to run into the hassle of finding awesome beaches to chill out. Hence, we built this website which will tell some amazing beaches according to entered preferences of the user.

# What it does
This is a simple website which takes user's preferences for the beach as its input and then tell beaches accordingly. Also, we haven't neglected the safety of people. The website also lists the Covid-19 situation at different beaches.

# How we built it
We have built the project using HTML,CSS and Javascript.

# Challenges we ran into
Firstly, it took us a significant amount of time to segregate beaches and their data so that we can correct output based on user's inputs. Being new to tech, we faced some errors in our javascript code which were solved after some help from the documentation.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we were able to come with such an idea that helps people to get rid of all the tension without any hassle. Also, we have included the Covid situation at the beaches. Thus people can safely have fun.

# What we learned
We learned implementing our frontend skills to a real world project.

# What's next for BeachVibes
We aim to increase our database of beaches which will include beaches from India and abroad. Also, we'll connect backend to our project so that all our data can be efficiently stored and we can retrieve easily. Additionally, We wish to add more criteria for people so that there won't be troubles in their vacations.
